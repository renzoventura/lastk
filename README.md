# LastK

**Your performance. Beautifully presented.**

Every runner is an artist. Every run a canvas. LastK is just the brush.

## What is LastK?

LastK connects to Strava, pulls your run data, and transforms it into premium share-ready graphics.

Pick a run. Choose a photo. Add data-driven stickers — distance, pace, time, location, PRs — styled with intention. Export to your camera roll or share directly to Instagram Stories.

No tracking. No dashboards. No noise.
Just your performance, presented the way it deserves.

## Features

### Strava Integration

- OAuth sign-in — no separate account
- Automatic run feed with infinite scroll
- Real data: distance, pace, time, location, route maps

### Photo Editor

- Full-screen zoomable, pannable canvas
- Pinch to zoom, drag to reposition
- Stickers can be dragged freely — including off-edge for creative compositions
- Export matches what you see, pixel for pixel

### Data-Driven Sticker System

25 distinct sticker layouts across 7 categories:

- **Big Metric** — Hero numbers with supporting details
- **Bars & Strips** — Compact horizontal performance strips
- **Badges** — Rounded, centered compositions with labels
- **Editorial** — Structured label-over-value hierarchy
- **Compositions** — Asymmetric layouts with visual tension
- **Minimal & Special** — Clean single-metric and location stickers
- **PR Celebration** — Six dedicated layouts for personal records

Every sticker is dynamically populated from the selected run.

### Sharing

- **Instagram Stories** — One tap. Canvas exports to pasteboard, Instagram opens with the image as your story background.
- **Save** — Export to photo library at display scale
- **Share** — System share sheet for any destination

### Design System

- Dark theme with strong orange accent
- Centralized color, typography, spacing, and corner radius tokens
- Four reusable button styles: Accent, Accent Outline, Ghost, Floating Circle
- Custom display fonts: Humane Bold, ROUND8-FOUR
- Built for future light mode

## Tech Stack

### Architecture

View-centric SwiftUI with `@Observable` services. Views own transient state. Observable classes manage shared and persistent state. No third-party dependencies.

### State Management

| Layer | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Auth & session | `@Observable` `StravaSession`, injected via `.environment()` |
| Feed | `@Observable` `RunFeedViewModel` with pagination |
| Photo library | `@Observable` `PhotoLibraryService`, local to picker |
| Canvas | `@State` arrays and bindings, local to editor |

### Networking

- Raw `URLSession` with `async/await`
- Static API clients (`StravaAuthService`, `StravaAPIClient`)
- OAuth2 with automatic token refresh via Keychain

### Strava API

- `ASWebAuthenticationSession` for OAuth login
- Secure token storage in Keychain (`StravaTokenStore`)
- Activity feed with polyline decoding for MapKit route rendering
- In-memory map snapshot cache to prevent scroll jitter

### Sticker Engine

```
RunFeedItem
  → .stickerData (immutable snapshot)
    → StickerLayoutType.allCases.filter(isAvailable)
      → StickerLayoutRouter (switch → view)
        → StickerOverlayView (drag, pinch, animate)
          → StickerDrawingView (export)
```

Adding a new sticker: add a case to the enum, create the view, register in the router. The picker, canvas, and export pipeline adapt automatically.

### Design Tokens

All visual constants live in `AppTheme.swift`:

- `AppColors` — backgrounds, text, accent, utility
- `AppFont` — metric, header, body, metadata, button
- `AppSpacing` — xs through xxl
- `AppRadius` — sm, md, lg, card
